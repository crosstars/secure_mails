In this project a prototype of an email service has
been built in which the user's password will be stored in form of an md5 hash in the
server(Firebase realtime database (NoSQL) used as a server), user's public key will be stored
in a byte format in the database and the private key of the user will be stored in the userâ€™s
machine in byte format. Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Key Exchange is used to generate
public, and private key pairs and ensure secure key exchange so that the final 256-bit
symmetric key for encryption/decryption is only available to the sender and the receiver, the
message will be encrypted with widely used symmetric encryption algorithm AES(In this
project we have used AES-256). For GUI implementation we used PyQt. It is a Python
interface for Qt, one of the most powerful, and popular cross-platform GUI libraries. PyQt5 is
a blend of the Python programming language and the Qt library.
